<p><b>A â€º pencil (also called: graphite pencil) </b>is a writing utensil with a graphite lead embedded in a wooden shaft. It is mainly used for artistic sketching and drawing, for stenography or notes. Its benefits are the simple usage as well as being able to remove what you've drawn with an eraser.</p>
