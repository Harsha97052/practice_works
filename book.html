<p>People who study the origin of language (etymologists) think that the reason why the word “book” derives from “beech” is that the first writing was inscribed on slabs of wood, called tablets, made out of beechwood, or maybe that <b>the first writing was inscribed on beech trees themselves.</b></p>
